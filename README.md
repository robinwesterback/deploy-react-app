# Megapixel Groups ROI Calculator
Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project @ Code Institute

This project is an investment calculator for calculating ROI (Return on Investment) built as a single page React application. 
It allows you to add businesses and campaigns, define your desired KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and reap the results. 
It has a button the user can click to clear/reset the inputs that has been made. 
The application provides a contact form, social links (LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram), contact information and a link to Megapixels marketing services.
You can find the application [here](https://robinwesterback.github.io/deploy-react-app/).

## UX
The application is designed to represent Megapixel, following their brand and graphic guidelines.
It is designed to be user friendly, simple and clean with the purpose to present all information in a visually appealing manner on all devices.
It is made for marketers/investors who wants a quick and easy way to calculate the ROI of their investments as well as getting related metrics valuable to interested parties. 
They want a hasslefree experience using the tool. If problem should arise it should be easy to get in touch with the owner of the application.
To provide that information this application is a simple and straightforward single-page-application with 5 major sections - Home, Business, Campaign, ROI and Support.
The support section provides a contact form, social links (LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram), contact information and a link to Megapixels marketing services.

### Strategy
The goal with the application is to provide quick and easy access to the functions, tools and recourses it provides.
The design should fit the purpose and follow Megapixels brand and graphic guidelines. 
The foundation of the application should be solid with room for improvement for future updates/releases.

### Scope
The users should be able to use a fully functioning application for calculating ROI including support if needed.
At this stage the user will experience a running application with the possibility to contact the owner with feedback for future releases.
Future releases may introduce:
 A wider range of KPIs and results
 The possibility to compare results to eachother
 Provide more information and resources about ROI and KPIs

### Structure
The application has a natural structure with the "home-section" giving a message, in this case welcoming the user to the application and describes how to use it. 
The next section is the "business-section", where you can add a businesses and define your KPIs.
The next section is the "campaign-section", where you can add a campaign and define your KPIs.
The result section follows where you can reap the results of your investments.
At the end of the application is the "support-section" with a contact form and a footer where you can access social-links, contact-info and a link to Megapixels marketing services.

### Skeleton
In this [link](https://github.com/robinwesterback/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/tree/master/wireframes) you can find the wireframes for each section that serves as the skeleton for the project.

### Surface
In this [link](https://github.com/robinwesterback/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Milestone-Project/tree/master/wireframes) you can find Megapixels website. 
This application follows Megapixels brand and graphic guidelines.
The white background works well with the logo, buttons and font colors. 
The design is clean and the orange color presents the information in a pleasant way.

## Features
The application contains several features with a few left to be implemented.

### Existing Features

#### Hamburger drop down menu
A function that uses Reacts useState to change the state of the element onClick.
Find out more about Reacts useState [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html "Using the State Hook").
The design is made to follow Megapixels brand and graphic guidelines.

#### ROI Calculator
An ROI calculator that is used for businesses and campaigns in this project. 
The calculator contains several variables, runs functions, passes and stores information.
You can add a new business or campaign, enter the KPIs that you want and get the results in an instant. 
The calculator is built using hooks. 
Find out more about hooks [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html "Hooks API Reference").

##### Get business/campaign
Gets the name of all the items in every business/campaign.

##### Clear
Empties the values of the form, result and business/campaign.

##### Calculate result
Calculates the result of the inserted KPIs and updates the result.

##### Add business/campaign
Adds a business/campaign that have pre-defined KPIs that can be filled in with desired KPIs.

##### On form changed
When the form is changed the results are updated automatically.

#### Send email
I use emailjs to let the user send emails to the site owner. 
I used the information from [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/ "EmailJS + React") to make it work.  
The user get notified wether it was a success or of it failed.

#### Links
I provide several links on the application for navigation in the header and footer.

### Features Left to Implement

#### More options to the calculator
A wider range of KPIs and results. The possibility to compare results to eachother and show visually appealing results.

#### Recourses and content
Provide more information and resources about ROI and KPIs. Also add images, videos and make the application more visually appealing where appropriate.
Add questionmarks that shows helpful information on hover.

#### 404 error
I want to customize the 404 error webpage.

#### Livechat
I might add a live-chat or integrate one from Pipedrive to provide additional ways of communicating with me.

#### Your thoughts
Are there any features that you would like me to implement to improve the application? Please get in touch and share your thoughts.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript in this project. I decided to use the React framework and created a react app. 
As I'm done with the first version of this project I'm happy that I chose to build a single page application in React.
It will be easy to implement future releases and continue to develop the functions the app provides.

### HTML
This project uses semantic [HTML](https://html.com/) to improve SEO and user friendliness. 
The HTML is rendered from jsx-files in this React app.

### CSS
The project uses responsive design to improve the user experience and availability on all devices. 
The [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) is separated using comments. 
I have a [reset stylesheet](https://cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/) to reduce browser 
inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. 

### JS
I used [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) for all the functions and interactivity on the application. 
Comments are provided to give an explanation of the functions.

### React
I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a framework for all the functions and states. 
React is a JavaScript library that builds user interfaces for single-page applications by dividing UI into composable components.
Businesses that use ReactJS are assured of better performance compared to those that use other frameworks. 
Because ReactJS helps to prevent updating of DOM, it means that the apps will be faster and deliver better UX. 
ReactJS was designed to help improve the total rendered pages from the website server.

## Testing
I have tested the website and looked for flaws in the design and errors in the functionality on several browsers on desktop, laptop and iPhone 7.
I have also tested the user stories to see if the website fills its purpose towards the user. 
The expected outcome is that the design is responsive and functional on all browsers/devices. 
Functions like links, overlay menu and contact form should work properly e.g "target=”_blank"" where appropriate. Below are my findings and comments.

### Functionality

| Description   | Expected outcome | Pass | Comments |
| ------------- |:----------------:| ----:| --------:|
| Click anywhere in the home-section | Links should work | Yes | - |
| Click anywhere in the about-section | Links should work | Yes | - |
| Click anywhere in the projects-section | Links should work | Yes | - |
| Click anywhere in the contact-section | Links should work, input- and text fields should require text/e-mail. | Yes | Form validation isn't implemented, clicking the "send" button should direct you to 404. |

### User Stories

| Description   | Expected outcome | Pass | Comments |
| ------------- |:----------------:| ----:| --------:|
| Find information about me and what I offer | Go to the about-section and read | Yes | - |
| Find previous work | Go to the projects-section and click the project | Yes | The projects are temporary and will be updated in the future as I get projects to showcase |
| Find contact info | Go to the contact-section and find e-mail or use form | Yes | Form validation doesn't function but will be implemented in the future |
| Find social links and resume | Click the social links in the footer | Yes | - |
| Navigate the website easily | Click the navigation links to get directed to the desired section | Yes | - |


### Different Browsers and devices

#### Desktop

| Description   | Expected outcome | Pass | Comments |
| ------------- |:----------------:| ----:| --------:|
| Internet Explorer | The website works appropriately | No | The header has a transparent background |
| Google Chrome | The website works appropriately | Yes | - |
| Mozilla Firefox | The website works appropriately | No | "background-filter: blur" doesn't work |
| Safari | The website works appropriately | Yes | - |

#### Mobile

| Description   | Expected outcome | Pass | Comments |
| ------------- |:----------------:| ----:| --------:|
| Google Chrome | The website works appropriately | No | "background-filter: blur" doesn't work |
| Safari | The website works appropriately | No | "background-filter: blur" doesn't work |

### Responsiveness

I have tested the responsiveness of the website [here](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) and it is responsive.

![alt text](assets/images/responsive.jpg "Responsiveness")

### Code validation

#### CSS
I validated my CSS with the [Jigsaw W3C Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). I got one error regarding the "backdrop-filter: blur" element in the ".overlay" class.
I found this [information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) regarding the issue. It is an element in development and thereof not compatible with all browsers to this date.
I put the opacity to 0.9 for the users using non-compatible browsers to not get affected by the element not working.

#### HTML
I validated my HTML with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) with no errors or warnings to show.

### Defensive design
When users try to send the form without filling in the input- and text fields warning messages pop-up in the required fields.

### Conclusion
After testing the deployed website my overall conclusion is that the website is working as intended. 
The minor flaws that exist don’t ruin the user experience but should be corrected in the future.
